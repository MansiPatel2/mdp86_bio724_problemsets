Fig 4, panel G and N
these figures has y axis structure that can easily me misinterpreted. the difference beween the two conditions look bigger than it actually is. while it might me justifiable, i think it should the actually poings for the daf-2 should have been not too close to 0 because it makes it look like it is 0, but it probably isn't.

### data lunch
This weeks data lunch session was about the final project involving finding and recreating an image from a published paper with available dataset
