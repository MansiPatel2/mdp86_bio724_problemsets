Nice choice of plot and writeup! You are clear to go ahead with the project. Here are some comments from the instructors:

* The full figure is a lot, although the individual components are fairly simple and draw from the same datasets. If you get stuck on the analysis or find that data is missing, reach out and we can discuss dropping any of the panels to make it simpler.
* R has limited options for venn diagrams that have proportional area to the number of samples. You could try shading the circles corresponding to the sample number, or just use a symmetrical venn diagram from a package like ggVennDiagram.
* The labeling for the volcano plot might be a little complex, but the ggrepel package should be helpful
