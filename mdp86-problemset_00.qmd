## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Problems

### 1.

Describe problem 1

```{r}
# Your code here
```

### 2.

Describe problem 2.

Add `error=TRUE` to your code block header if it has an error but you don't want that error to interrupt execution of the rest of your notebook.

```{r, error=TRUE}
# Code that generates an error
```

Provide a written description of how you've tried to diagnose the issues you're running into that generate the error above.

### 3.

Describe problem 3.

```{r}
# more code here
```

If necessary or useful provide a description of how your code solves the problem.
